							<p>11.30.2009</p>
						</header>

						<p>
He is called Beelzebul or Beelzebub and is the lord of the highest ranking devils amongst devils. But, he falls to the lowest rank in charge of dirty filth after he lost to 'the fallen angel, Lucifer' who fell to the world of the devils from the world of the angels.</br></br>
						
Beelzebul lost all the power in a day, and is called the Fly King. He became a joke for all the devils. This event created the card game, 'Beelzebul' because it was spread out to devils for a long time In the trump, each number symbolizes devils.</br></br>

The card which symbolizes 'Lucifer' is the most powerful card, 'A', on the other hand, the weakest card, '2' symbolizes Beelzebul. But, the number 2 which contains the firing revenge of Beelzebul is used as the most powerful card in this game, Beelzebul.</br></br>

The game uses a one card method using the genealogy of poker.</br></br>

1. The goal of the game</br>
- It is to get rid of all the cards players have.</br></br>

2. Game process</br>
- Card distribution :</br>
When the game starts, all the players receive 13 cards.</br>
- Advance decision :</br>
When you start your game, the leader of the first game is the one who owns 3â—†, from the following game, the leader is the winner of the last game. If the game has started, the one who passes all the players with his or her cards becomes the leader.</br>
- Play direction :</br>
The play goes counterclockwise from the leader.</br>
- Direction of the game :</br>
Players get rid of their cards in their turn according to the following rules.</br>
1) If you are the leader, arrange the cards according to the genealogy in the order of 1,2,3 and 5 card types.</br>
2) If you are not the leader, arrange and put stronger cards among the card type which the leader chose. If you don't have a card to put down, you pass your turn to the next player.</br></br>

3. Game over</br>
If anybody plays all the cards they own, the game is over and the rest of the players lose the points corresponding to the number of cards they own.</br></br>

If a card contains the same genealogy, the order is like this, type>number>pattern. The difference between this game and Poker is that Four Card is not 4 cards but 5 cards, because there is no Four Card type and no Two Pairs. The other type of relationships are the same as Poker.</br></br>
